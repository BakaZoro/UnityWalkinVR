C# scripts to move in VR and then move from one scene to another

You might wonder about how to move characters from one scene to another. In VR, if you're using photospheres you'd be using Sphere GameObejct. Therefore, if you want to be able to move the character from one sphere to another. Say by looking at an arrow. This is what you'd do.

The second script is a better script where you're alignment is always maintained. You feel a smooth transition as you shift scenes in VR.
